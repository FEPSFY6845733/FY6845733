      <h2> In an ever-changing society that requires more focus on climate change, we urgently need to find alternative power sources.  Sources that produce less carbon and greenhouse gases and are kinder to our environment, but are powerful enough to sustain the world we live in. One such solution is the use of piezoelectricity. Piezoelectric is the charge that is generated by certain solid materials, such as crystals and ceramics, which when placed under mechanical stress, can convert pressure and vibrations into electrical energy. An efficient way of utilizing these crystals would be through placement in highly used roads, with high amounts of traffic flow. The crystals will be placed around 5 centimetres below the asphalt or road surface and the pressure exerted on the roads from the vehicles will cause a deformation in the crystal.  The deformation of the crystal allows wasted energy to be transferred into electrical energy.  Research claims that the use of these renewable energy devices, if planted along a one kilometre stretch of road, could provide an average of 400kW of power, enough to power 162 homes. Theoretically, the system can produce one-kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity for every 12 metres of road. To achieve this rate, the system must be implemented on fast, busy roads.</h2>
